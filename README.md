# Gabi Berbetoros Porfoltio

I created a portfolio for my musician and sound designer Friend to help him with his career and also it helps me at practicing my web development skills.

### Why?
To help my friend and practice, I made a portfolio without any framework.
What I'm practicing with this:

- CSS
- HTML
- Mobile first approach
- Responsive design
- SEO
- BEM Naming convention

# Local Setup

```sh
Just clone it and open index.html
```
